Program uses an enumeration to represents the different pricing phases for a ski resort

How It Works:


A fictitious ski resort prices their monthly passes based on the time of the year. This program contains an enumeration that represents the different pricing phases of the year. The user is prompted for the type of pass they want and the cost is displayed. Prices are as follows:

May through August: $50 (for people to come and hike/bicycle)
September or October: $100
November: $120
December: $130
January or February: $135
March or April: $110
